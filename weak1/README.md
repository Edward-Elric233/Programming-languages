# Weak1 Homework Assignment

I submitted my homework twice after i finished it, and an error occurred because the input and output of a function(number_before_reaching_sum) are not clear.



One of the biggest lessons learned from this assignment is that if a function returns a Boolean, you should use logical expression rather than if else statements whenever possible, which greatly simplifies the code.
